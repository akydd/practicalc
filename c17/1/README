How to perform text file insert operations

1. Open file, read entire contents info a buffer char array of some max size.
2. When print_line(string) is called, use fgetpos to set the file position in
   fpos_t *pos.
3. Match pos with the index in the buffer
4. Shift all txt in the buffer over by strlen(string).  If length exceeds
   buffer size, truncate.
5. Write modified buffer back to the file
